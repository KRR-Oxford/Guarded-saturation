# Guarded-saturation

The software implements a Resolution-based rewriting algorithm from Guarded Tuple Generating Dependencies (GTGDs) to Datalog, along with some functions
for running the resulting Datalog rules.

<!-- Description: A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does. -->

## Saturating 

The main functionality of GSat is to compute the saturation of a set of TGDs. The corresponding command line is (the JAR file is available with the [releases](https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/Guarded-saturation/releases)):
```bash
java -jar guarded-saturation-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar <syntax> <TGD file>
```
where `<syntax>` is the one of the syntax `dlgp`, `owl` and `<TGD file>` is a file containing the input GTGDs in the syntax `<syntax>`.

By default, the output saturation is printed in the console, it can be written to a file instead by setting `write_output` to `true` in the file `config.properties`.

### Example

Consider a DLGP file `example.dlgp` that contains the following two TGDs:
```
b(X, Y), c(Y) :-  a(X).
d(X) :- b(X, Y), c(Y).
```

Calling:
```bash
java -jar guarded-saturation-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar dlgp example.dlgp
```
returns the saturation corresponding to:
```
b(X, Y), c(Y) :-  a(X).
d(X) :- a(X).
```

### Choice the saturation algorithm

This project implements different saturation algorithms. You can set the algorithm to use by changing `saturation_alg`'s value in the file `config.properties` to either:

- `gsat` (default) corresponding to `ExbDR` in the article
- `skolem_sat` corresponding to `SkolemDR` 
- `hyper_sat` corresponding to `HyperDR`
- `ordered_skolem_sat` also called `KAON3`
- `simple_sat` a naive saturation algorithm

Additionally, Gsat can be use to get the saturation of the set of TGDs in a OWL file using the following command:
```bash
java -cp guarded-saturation-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar "uk.ac.ox.cs.gsat.ExecutorOWL" <OWL file> <timeout>
```
where the `<timeout>` is expressed in seconds.

## Compilation (For developers)

### Prerequisites

To build the software we require

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java)
- [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org)
- [PDQ](https://github.com/ProofDrivenQuerying/pdq)
- [KAON 2](http://kaon2.semanticweb.org)

Kaon2 is only relevant for some experiments, and is not part of the delivered product.

#### Installing PDQ in Maven

1. Download from [PDQ releases](https://github.com/ProofDrivenQuerying/pdq/releases)
   - pdq-common-1.0.0.jar
2. Install as in [the official documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html)
   - `mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.5.2:install-file -Dfile="pdq-common-1.0.0.jar"`

#### Installing KAON 2

Install the JAR of KAON2 using 
```
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./src/main/resources/kaon2.jar -DgroupId=org.semanticweb.kaon2 -DartifactId=kaon2 -Dversion=2008-06-29 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true
```

### Installing

If you are a developer and you want to run the tests, you need to:

1. Download the "test-all.zip" file from [GSat test datasets](https://github.com/stefanogermano/Guarded-saturation/releases/tag/test-data)
2. Extract it in the root of the project

Otherwise, you can simply run the `download-test-datasets.sh` script.

Build the project:

```sh
mvn verify
```

That's it! If you look in the `target` subdirectory, you should find the build output.

### Running the saturation on Chase Bench

In addition to what have been said in the usage section [ChaseBench](https://dbunibas.github.io/chasebench) format can also be used for the input.

To run on a ChaseBench scenario, you need to specify the `cb` option and add:

- `<NAME OF THE SCENARIO>` the name of the scenario as in the ChaseBench format
  - example: `doctors`
- `<PATH OF THE BASE FOLDER>` the directory that contains this scenario
  - example: `test/ChaseBench/scenarios/doctors`
- `[<FACT/QUERY SIZE>]` (optional) the size of the scenario that you want to test
  - example: `100k`

### Useful Maven commands for developers

Check PDM violations and bugs in code:

```sh
mvn pmd:check

mvn spotbugs:check
```

Update Maven dependencies and Plugins:

```sh
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates

mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
```

Generate Javadoc:

```sh
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

<!-- Contributing: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work.

## Experiments

Experiments are available in a submodule, which may be large. You can initialize the experiments folder using:
```sh
git submodule init
```
