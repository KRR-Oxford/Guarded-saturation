The skolemised approach is the one described in Definition 5.2.17 in the
thesis. It is the one that ends up being the same as the one by De
Nivelle et al.

Summary of the approach: For GTGDs, we first make all rules single
headed, skolemise, and start resolving. Each resolution step takes one
non-full rule r -- that is, one with a skolem in the head -- with head atom H and another rule r' containing a body
atom B' such that either:

1. r' is full (no skolems in the head) and B' is its guard or
2. B' contains a function symbol
If H and B' unify, we resolve the rules and add them to our set.

One key difference between GSAT and the unskolemised approach is that
the former can resolve multiple atoms at a time but in exchange might
create larger rules; the latter only performs binary resolution and
hence might take more resolution steps to finish but also creates
smaller rules.

Example 6.2.1 in the thesis
shows a simple case where the unskolemised approach can be
beneficial (in terms of resolution steps required) as it resolves
multiple atoms at once.



The following example, on the other hand, might be a candidate where
GSat does worse. Consider the following set of rules

B1(x) -> H1(x,y1,y2)
H1(x,x1,x2),B2(x) -> H2(x1,x2)
H1(x,x1,x2),B3(x) -> H3(x1,x2)

Then GSat creates

B1(x),B2(x) -> H1(x,y1,y2),H2(y1,y2)
B1(x),B3(x) -> H1(x,y1,y2),H3(y1,y2)
B1(x),B2(x),B3(x) -> H1(x,y1,y2),H2(y1,y2),H3(y1,y2)

and the skolemised approach creates

B1(x),B2(x) -> H2(f(x),g(x))
B1(x),B3(x) -> H3(f(x),g(x))

assuming that y1 got skolemised to f(x) and y2 to g(x).

Here GSat created larger rules and an additional rule which shortcuts
binary resolution steps. If there would have been an additional rule in
the input

H1(x,x1,x2),H2(x1,x2),H3(x1,x2) -> P(x)

this shortcut would show its merits.

Here's another difference: GSat does not resolve when
existentials/skolemised variables would be introduced in the body, which
can be beneficial (but I guess to a neglectable degree). For example,
given the following rules:

B1(x) -> H1(x,y1,y2)
H1(x,x1,x2),B2(x1) -> H2(x1,x2)
H1(x,x1,x2),B3(x1) -> H3(x1,x2)

GSat would not resolve anything while the skolemised approach would create

B1(x),B2(f(x)) -> H2(f(x),g(x))
B1(x),B3(f(x)) -> H3(f(x),g(x))
